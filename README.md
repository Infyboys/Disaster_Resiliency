## Short description

### What's the problem?

With the increase in world tourism, number of cross-border travellers has increased around the globe. When a natural disaster hits an area, the tourists suffer the most.

### How can technology help?

It is necessary to make the tourists aware about the climate as well as the history of disasters that occurred at a place over a period of time.

### The idea

It's important to provide the tourists a guide to check the history of natural calamities, its severities, preparations required before making arrangements for the tour. An application with easy-to-search UI with map interface will help them go through various places and their history.
