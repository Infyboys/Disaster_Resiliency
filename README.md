## Short description

### What's the problem?

With the increase in world tourism, number of cross-border travellers has increased around the globe. When a natural disaster hits an area, the tourists suffer the most.T

### How can technology help?

It is necessary to make the tourists aware about the climate as well as the history of disasters that occurred at a place over a period of time.

### The idea

It's important to provide the tourists a guide to check the history of natural calamities, its severities, preparations required before making arrangements for the tour. An application with easy-to-search UI with map interface will help them go through various places and their history.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```bash
dnf install wget
wget http://www.example.com/install.sh
bash install.sh
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be, for example

```bash
export TOKEN="fffd0923aa667c617a62f5A_fake_token754a2ad06cc9903543f1e85"
export EMAIL="jane@example.com"
dnf install npm
node samplefile.js
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

And repeat

```bash
curl localhost:3000
Thanks for looking at Code-and-Response!
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
